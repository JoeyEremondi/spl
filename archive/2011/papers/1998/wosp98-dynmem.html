<H4>Abstract</H4>

Increasingly, new applications are being built by composing existing
software components rather than by coding a system from scratch. Using
this approach, applications can be built quickly. Far too often,
however, these applications do not exhibit acceptable performance. The
benefits of construction through composition could be more reliably
achieved if a software engineer could assess the performance impact of
a component prior to its use. In this paper, we present our
experiences of taking a straightforward approach to a piece of this
problem: predicting the memory use of an existing component for a new
application. The approach consists of annotating a structural
view---a class diagram---of an object-oriented component with data
gathered from sample existing uses of the component. The annotated
view is then used as a basis for prediction.  Our experience
highlights several of the difficulties software engineers face in not
only predicting, but also in analyzing, the space performance of
existing object-oriented components.
