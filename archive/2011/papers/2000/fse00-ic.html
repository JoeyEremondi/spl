<H4>Abstract</H4>

<P>
Software systems should consist of simple, conceptually clean software
components interacting along narrow, well-defined paths.  All too often,
this is not reality: complex components end up interacting for reasons
unrelated to the functionality they provide.  We refer to knowledge
within a component that is not conceptually required for the individual
behaviour of that component as extraneous embedded knowledge (EEK).  EEK
creeps into a system in many forms, including dependences upon
particular names and the passing of extraneous parameters.  This paper
proposes the use of implicit context as a means for reducing EEK in
systems by combining a mechanism to reflect upon what has happened in
a system, through queries on the call history, with a mechanism for
altering calls to and from a component.  We demonstrate the benefits of
implicit context by describing its use to reduce EEK in the
Java<SUP><FONT SIZE=-1>TM</FONT></SUP> Swing library.
