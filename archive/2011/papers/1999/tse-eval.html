<H4>Abstract</H4>

Determining whether a new software development technique is useful and
usable is a challenging task.  Various flavours of empirical study may
be used to help with this task, including surveys, case studies, and
experiments.  Little guidance is available within the software
engineering community to help choose among these alternatives when
assessing a new and evolving software development technique within
some cost bounds.  We faced this challenge when assessing a new
programming technique called aspect-oriented programming.  To assess
the technique, we chose to apply both a case study approach and a
series of four experiments because we wanted to understand and
characterize the kinds of information that each approach might
provide.  In this paper, we describe and critique the evaluation
methods we employed, and discuss the lessons we have learned.  These
lessons are applicable to researchers attempting to assess new
programming techniques that are in an early stage of development.
