<H4>Abstract</H4>
The Advanced Teaching and Learning Academic Server (Atlas) is a 
software system that supports web-based learning. Students can
register for courses, and can navigate through personalized views
of course material. Atlas has been built according to Sun
Microsystem's Java (TM) Servlet specification using Xerox
PARC's aspect-oriented programming support called AspectJ (TM).
Since aspect-oriented programming is still in its infancy,
little experience with employing this paradigm is currently
available. In this paper, we start filling this gap by
describing the aspects we used in Atlas, and by discussing the
effect of aspects on our object-oriented development practices.
We describe some rules and policies that we employed to 
achieve our goals of maintainability and modifiability,
and introduce a straightforward notation to express the design
of aspects. Although we faced some small hurdles along the way,
this combination of technology helped us build a fast,
well-structured system in a reasonable amount of time.
