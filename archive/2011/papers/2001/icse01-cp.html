<H4>Abstract</H4>

Requirements such as distribution or tracing have an impact on
multiple classes in a system.  They are cross-cutting requirements, or
<em>aspects</em>.  Their support is, by necessity, scattered across
those multiple classes.  A look at an individual class may also show
support for cross-cutting requirements tangled up with the core
responsibilities of that class.  Scattering and tangling make
object-oriented software difficult to understand, extend and reuse.
Though design is an important activity within the software lifecycle
with well-documented benefits, those benefits are reduced when
cross-cutting requirements are present.  This paper presents a means
to mitigate these problems by separating the design of cross-cutting
requirements into <em>composition patterns</em>.  Composition patterns
require extensions to the UML, and are based on a combination of the
subject-oriented model for composing separate, overlapping designs,
and UML templates.  This paper also demonstrates how composition
patterns map to one programming model that provides a solution for
separation of cross-cutting requirements in code aspect-oriented
programming.  This mapping serves to illustrate that separation of
aspects may be maintained throughout the software lifecycle.
