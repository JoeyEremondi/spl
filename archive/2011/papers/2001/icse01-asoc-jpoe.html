<H4>Abstract</H4>

Implicit context is a recently introduced mechanism for improving
source code structure, making components more reusable, and making
their systems more evolvable.  It worries about eliminating
locally-unneeded knowledge of external components (<em>extraneous
embedded knowledge</em>, or <em>EEK</em>).  Aspect-oriented
programming (AOP) is a separation of concerns mechanism.  It worries
about separating and encapsulating functionality that crosscuts the
components of a system.  AspectJ is a prototype AOP language.

<p>Both approaches can be seen to manipulate software at
<em>joinpoints</em>, points in the execution or lexical description of
that software.  Joinpoints and the related code to execute at them can
be considered as an event-based system.  The exposure of events in
AspectJ differs from that in implicit context---AspectJ considers
these events as immediate and largely independent, while implicit
context considers them as historic and interrelated through its
\emph{call history} concept.  We give an example of a system in which
limiting the description of the events of interest to those currently
available in AspectJ results in an error-prone and hard-to-evolve
implementation, but in which the use of call history would lead to a
more reusable and robust implementation.  We also briefly examine the
issue of EEK and its removal within this example.
