<H4>Abstract</H4>

Requirements that have a crosscutting impact on software (such as
distribution or persistence) present many problems for software
development that manifest themselves throughout the lifecycle.
Inherent properties of crosscutting requirements, such as
<em>scattering</em> (where their support is scattered across multiple
classes) and <em>tangling</em> (where their support is tangled with
elements supporting other requirements), reduce the reusability,
extensibility, and traceability of the affected software artefacts.
Scattering and tangling exist both in designs and code and must
therefore be addressed in both.

<p>To remove scattering and tangling properties, a means to separate
the designs and code of crosscutting behaviour into independent models
or programs is required.  This paper discusses approaches that achieve
exactly that in either designs or code, and presents an investigation
into a means to maintain this separation of crosscutting behaviour
seamlessly across the lifecycle.  To achieve this, we work with
<em>composition patterns</em> at the design level, <em>AspectJ</em>
and <em>Hyper/J</em> at the code level, and investigate a mapping
between the two levels.  Composition patterns are a means to separate
the design of crosscutting requirements in an encapsulated,
independent, reusable, and extensible way.  AspectJ and Hyper/J are
technologies that provide similar levels of separation for Java code.
We discuss each approach, and map the constructs from composition
patterns to those of AspectJ and Hyper/J.  We first illustrate
composition patterns with the design of the Observer pattern, and then
map that design to the appropriate code.  As this is achieved with
varying levels of success, the exercise also serves as a case study in
using those implementation techniques.
