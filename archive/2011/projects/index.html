<p><h2>Projects</h2>

<P> Our research focuses on methods and tools to help software
developers manage and evolve the structure of the software systems
they are developing both at design time and in source code. In
particular, we are working on approaches that help developers assess
various design alternatives when performing a software engineering
task.  Since new methods and tools have little value unless useful to
"real" software developers, we are also working on assessment methods
to understand how to better validate our research results.

<P><H3>Design Aids and Approaches</H3>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088">Predicting Memory Use 
(<A HREF="../../../~murphy/index.html">Murphy</A>,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~cubranic">Cubranic</A>,
Saenko).</FONT></I>
Increasingly, new applications are being built by composing existing
software components rather than by coding a system from scratch. Using
this approach, applications can be built quickly. Far too often,
however, these applications do not exhibit acceptable performance. The
benefits of construction through composition could be more reliably
achieved if a software engineer could assess the performance impact of
a component prior to its use. We have done some initial investigations
of a method to predict memory use for C++ components. We are currently
working on prediciting memory use for Java components as part of <A
HREF="http://www.cser.ca">CSER</A> in cooperation with <A
HREF="http://www.oti.com">OTI, Inc.</A> (<A
HREF="../papers/1998/wosp98-dynmem.html">Workshop Paper</A>)

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088">Interaction-based Programming (<A
HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~gslee">Lee</A>).</FONT></I>
Interaction-based programming is an experimental approach aimed at
improving the reusability of components by providing first-class
language constructs---software interactions---to moderate
communications between component interfaces. An interaction-based
approach is being taken in the development of the RASP
toolkit that supports the development of visual simualtions.

<P><H3>Source Code Analysis</H3>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088">Exception Flow Analysis in Java
(<A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mrobilla">Robillard</A>, 
<A HREF="../../../~murphy/index.html">Murphy</A>).
</FONT></I>Because of unchecked exceptions and of subsumption
of exception types in method headers, it's difficult for
programmers to reason about the flow of exceptions in Java programs.
We have developed a static analysis to called <I>Jex</I>, to extract
detailed exception flow information from Java programs.
The main purpose of Jex is to help developers improve their
error-handling code.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088">Conceptual Modules 
(Baniassad, 
<A HREF="../../../~murphy/index.html">Murphy</A>).
</FONT></I>  We have
developed a tool, called the <I>conceptual module</I> tool, to help
software developers extract components from existing systems.  This
tool allows a developer to query source code in terms of components
that do not conform to existing structures, such as procedures, in the
code base.  This tool may have applications in software architecture
and design conformance checking.

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088">Visualization (<A
HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~walker">Walker</A>, <A
HREF="../../../~murphy/index.html">Murphy</A>, and a bunch
of OTI folks).
</FONT></I> In
cooperation with <A HREF="http://www.oti.com/">OTI Inc.</A> and <A
HREF="http://www.cser.ca">CSER</A>, we are investigating techniques to
visualize information about the execution of an object-oriented
system.  The intent of this work is to find effective techniques to
help software developers perform various software engineering tasks,
such as improving the performance of a system. (<A

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088"><A NAME="ConcernGraphs">Concern Graphs </A>(<A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mrobilla">Robillard</a>, <A HREF="../../../~murphy/index.html">Murphy</a>)
</FONT></I>
A Concern Graph provides an abstract representation of a concern in a software system code. The representation abstracts the implementation details
of a concern and makes explicit the relationships between  different parts
of a concern. From the representation, there is an obvious
and inexpensive mapping back to the source code.  The FEAT (Feature
Exploration and Analysis) tool allows a developer to manipulate
a concern representation extracted from a Java system, and to
analyze the relationships of that concern to the code base.

<P><H3>Assessment</H3>

<P><I><FONT COLOR="#000088"><a name="AOPAssess">Aspect-oriented Programming
Assessment</a>
(Baniassad,
<A HREF="../../../~murphy/index.html">Murphy</A>,
<A HREf="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~walker">Walker</A>)
.</FONT></I> Software design and implementation approaches
and development support tools are valuable only if a developer can
effectively use them to build and maintain software products.  We are
investigating case study and experimental methods by which software
engineering researchers may evaluate claims made about new software
engineering techniques and tools. Most of our work in this
area has been in the context of early assessment of AOP.
